1. What is JSX? What is one syntax difference between HTML and JSX?

Your answer: JSX is a combination of JavaScript and HTML code. It allows us to combine both codes into one file. HTML uses the greater than less than syntaxs. I need to review the HTML coding langauge more because I do not remember the name of the HTML syntax, but it is shows like this: <> </>. To have JavaScript code you need to use {} curly brakets which lets the program know that whatever is inside the brakets is JavaScript code and not HTML.  

Researched answer: After researching my answer I realized that I read the question wrong. JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It allows us to write HTML in React. The syntax they both use is the tag syntax. The differnece between the tag syntax in HTML and JSK would be that HTML does not have to return a single parent element while the JSK requires you to return a signle parent element. 

2. What is yarn? What file(s) are modified when you run the command yarn in your terminal?

Your answer: I am not entierely sure what yarn is, but I do know that it works with JavaScript and React. It also works within the computers terminal to run code. All the files that you work on are modified after you work on them once you run the command in the terminal. 

Researched answer: After researching the answer I learned that yarn is a package manager. It allows developers to share code around the world. Everytime a developer runs the yarn command in the terminal the files that are updated are the package-lock.json and yarn.lock files.

3. What is the difference between state values and props in React?

Your answer: In simple terms, states values allow you to change hard code. You are allowed to change a hard codded code. A prop allows you to transfer data into other files within the same React App files. 

Researched answer: Props are used to pass data from one component to another compononent while state is used to manage data within the component it is called in. Props cannot change or be changed, but states can be updated using setState.

Researched answer: DOM, also known as Document Object Model is an important interface that allows interactions within the website. 

5. STRETCH: Which is the difference between a div tag and a span tag?

Your answer: I don't know or remember what a span tag is, but a div tag stands for divide which will divide whatever data you have written between the tag syntax. 

Researched answer: A span tag is used to group smaller pieces of text together. Div tags are used to group large pieces of text.
